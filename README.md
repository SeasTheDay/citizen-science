# Digital Tools for Citizen Science

Below is a curated list of awesome software and other resources to enable those who want to use scientific tools to empower communities and/or practice various forms of non-institutional science.  It is largely inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/drewrwilson/toolsforactivism) listing digital tools for activists.  Feel free to share suggestions. If you add software to the list, free and open-source software is strongly encouraged over proprietary software.

# The List

## software:

 * [Contact Congress (Open Source)](https://github.com/EFForg/contact-congress) - Send emails to members of the US Congress. This was developed by EFF as an open source project. They use it for their own campaigns internally. There is also a hosted version run by Fight for the Future (see below.

## equipment:

 * [Ci](http://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/) - use this to coordinate a group sharing the same message on social media at the same time. You write a tweet, make a campaign, and ask people to pledge to support your campaign. When you reach your goal of a certain number of pledgers, your tweet will automatically be posted to each pledger's social media.

## journals:

 * [Citizen Science: Theory and Practice](http://theoryandpractice.citizenscienceassociation.org/) - An open-access, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to discussion about methods in citizen science.
 * [Scholar Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/scholar) - A great place to request help getting access to scientific papers that are beyond paywalls.
 * [LibGen])(http://libgen.io/) - An online tool for gaining access to scientific articles that are normally beyond paywalls
